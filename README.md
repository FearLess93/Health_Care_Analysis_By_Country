# Health Care Analysis

## Project Goal
This project was undertaken to proactively identify which countries are in the most critical need of improved healthcare and welfare. The objective was to utilize provided databases containing global health and economic indicators to clean, transform, analyze, and visualize data to pinpoint nations requiring immediate intervention.

## ‚ùì Problem Statement
The core question guiding this analysis is:  
**Which countries are in dire need for improving healthcare to increase their life expectancy?**

## üìä Methodology: The Healthcare Need Index
To provide a quantitative answer, a combined metric called the **Healthcare Need Index (Score)** was engineered. This index aggregates and weights normalized scores for three key welfare metrics.  

The index was designed to treat all three normalized metrics equally to provide a balanced assessment of population, life expectancy, and GNI per capita.

## üíª Data Science Skills Demonstrated
This project showcases the application of fundamental data science and analytical techniques:

- **Feature Engineering:** Creating the composite Healthcare Need Index by combining and equally weighting three raw metrics (referred to as Metric A, B, and C) to form a single, decision-making score.
- **Data Transformation:** Normalizing raw data to a common scale (0 to 1) to ensure fair weighting and comparison across vastly different units and ranges.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Utilizing tools like visualizations (e.g., bar plots, scatter plots) to understand the distribution of the selected metrics and to identify global welfare clusters.
- **Data Merging & Cleaning:** Combining disparate data sources (likely containing population, economic, and health data) into a unified dataset for comprehensive analysis.

## ‚ú® Key Findings
The analysis successfully ranked nations based on their calculated need score, highlighting significant global disparities.  

**Top three countries identified as having the most critical need:**
1. **Mozambique** ‚Äì highest score
2. **Somalia**
3. **Central African Republic (CAR)**

The dominant factors driving these high need scores were the combined impact of the underlying welfare metrics. Furthermore, the analysis confirmed widespread global welfare differences by categorizing one of the core health metrics into groups: **Low, Medium, and High**.

## üìù Recommendations & Conclusion
Based on the quantitative findings of the Healthcare Need Index:  

- Immediate aid and healthcare resources should be directed to the top-ranked countries, particularly Mozambique, Somalia, and CAR.  
- Future programs should primarily focus on implementing measures that directly improve the two most critical welfare metrics, as these are the strongest drivers of poor well-being.  
- The calculated Healthcare Need Index should be adopted as a robust, quantitative metric to track and monitor the success and impact of all future health and development initiatives.
